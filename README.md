# BODY_PERFORMANCE
#Abstract
In this modern world of highly 
engaged schedules people seldom think about 
their body health. There are so many ways to 
relax the mind without movement keeping 
leisure at its peak but for keeping physical 
health on track one needs to give plenty of 
time for exercise and related activities. Taking 
into consideration teen groups it is easily 
observable they are not in good health. 
Growing technology has hit hard on physical 
activities on teenagers which creates a bad 
impact on their future life. The goal of this 
experiment is to build a model which detects 
the body performance of people lying between 
20 to 60 age groups, taking several parameters 
into account. Four machine learning classifiers 
are used for this classification problem. 
Hyperparameter tuning is used as a strategy to 
obtain the optimized variables for modeling. 
The classifying techniques used are Random 
Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree 
and Artificial Neural Network. The preferable 
result is obtained from Random Forest. The 
second-best result is achieved by a neural 
network. The performance metrics for 
evaluating the models are accuracy score and 
confusion matrix.

# Introduction
People rarely consider their physical health in 
today's world of hectic lifestyles. There are 
numerous ways to relax the mind without 
moving, allowing leisure to flourish, but to 
maintain physical health, ample time for 
exercise and related activities is required. 
When it comes to teen groups, it is obvious 
that they are not in excellent health. Growing 
technology has had a negative impact on 
teens' physical activities, which has a negative 
impact on their future lives. The purpose of this 
project is to create a model that detects the 
physical performance of people between the 
ages of 20 and 60 using a variety of criteria. 
Talking about classification problems, machine 
learning comes into picture. Several machine 
learning algorithms are used in order to check 
which is more suitable for taking into practice 
for body performance classification. Body 
performance dataset is taken from kaggle 
which has four grades in which oneâ€™s body 
performance can be classified. Several features 
are taken into account such as a person's age, 
gender, weight, heart rate, etc. 
Much related work has been done in this area 
to help people take these issues seriously and 
shows multiple predictions which can really 
help to spread awareness. Considering weight 
factor Jafari-Adli Sh, Jouyandeh Z & Qorbani 
M[1] has worked towards obesity and 
diabetes. Advanced research has been done on 
body movement during playing basketball by 
Lu Bai, Christos Efstratiou, Chee Siang Ang[2]. 
Body performance can also be observed using
sensors counting several other features and 
sports activities, this work has been proposed 
by Manju Rana[3], Vikas Mittal.
